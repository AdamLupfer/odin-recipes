    <h1>Simple Chili Recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe is a great way to make a big pot of chili effortlessly,
         great for cold winter evenings or if you're simply in the mood for 
         a bowl. And the best part? This recipe only requires 1 large pot! (preferably with a lid)</p>
    <p>To start off, here are the ingedients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (or turkey)</li>
        <li>2 poblano peppers, sliced however you prefer (I prefer julienned)</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>a chili seasoning packet (McCormick's works fine for this recipe, otherwise mix an even amount of chili 
            powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and salt together to make 
            one yourself :) )</li>
        <li>(Optional-ish) 1 can red kidney beans</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And for toppings, which are all optional:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, colby and mexican blends taste best but up to you)</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno, sliced</li>
        <li>side bowl of oyster crackers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To start off, set your pot on the stovetop and turn the heat up to a medium-high:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the pans starts to warm, place your ground beef/turkey in the pot and break it up, stirring to cook evenly</li>
        <li>If you'd like, once the meat is thouroughly browned, you may drain the fat from the pot with a strainer, although with turkey there may not be enough fat to drain</li>
        <li>Otherwise, as the meat begins to brown, toss in the onion and poblano peppers, and the packet of chili seasoning</li>
        <li>Stir everything evenly and turn heat down to medium</li>
        <li>Once pepper and onions have softened, go ahead and add the cans of tomato sauce and can of diced tomatoes. (as well as the kidney beans, if you're using them)</li>
        <li>Stir everything evenly and cover with a lid, allowing the chili to simmer for a bit</li>
        <li>After ~5-10 minutes, taste it, and add more salt/seasoning if it requires it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's ready to serve! Serves 4-5</p>
