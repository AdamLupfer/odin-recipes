    <h1>Philly Cheesesteak</h1>
    <p>This is a simple recipe for a cheesteak sub sandwich, loosely copying the Jersey Mike's
         famous philly cheesesteak. I like to add jalapenos and make my own chipotle mayo for 
         a spread, but you can customize this recipe to suit your cheesesteak needs as you deem fit.</p>
    <p>To start, all you need is a large pan, but a flattop griddle surface works best for this recipe</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 serving of frozen shaved beef steak planks</li>
        <li>1/4 sweet onion, julienned</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet peppers, sliced lengthwise (jarred works fine)</li>
        <li>2 slices of white american cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>A sub sandwich roll</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To start, heat the cooking surface to medium high heat</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the surface is sufficiently heated, add the steak planks and season with salt</li>
        <li>Stack the onion and peppers on top of the beef plank</li>
        <li>When the beef is brown underneath, flip the beef with a spatula, putting the peppers and onions underneath the beef. Season the beef with more salt</li>
        <li>Start chopping the beef and pepper/onion mixture on the cooktop, until finely chopped and mixed</li>
        <li>Once the beef is no longer red but still contains a bit of pink, shape the mixture into a portion approximetaly the same length as your sub roll. Stack the 2 slices of american cheese on the mixture and let melt</li>
        <li>While the cheese is melting, slice your sub roll lengthwise but only enough to open the bread roll up</li>
        <li>Microwave the bread roll for ~20 seconds</li>
        <li>When the roll is ready, take it out, holding it in one hand, and scoop the hot beef into the roll, filling it entirely lengthwise</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And serve! Serves ~1-2. </p>
